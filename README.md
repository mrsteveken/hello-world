# hello-world
my first Github repository as a non-programmer

I used to think programming is only for those CS students. But with advent of big data era and open source tools such as Python, Pandas readily available at my figure tips, I know it's time for me to change my view and devote to my dream as a Quant. 

But before that, I will use the GitHub to learn Python and data analysis as well as quantative investing and finance.
